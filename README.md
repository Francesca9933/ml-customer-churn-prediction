With the rapid development of the telecommunication industry, the service providers are more inclined towards the expansion of the subscriber base. To survive in the competitive environment, the retention of existing customers has become a huge challenge. It is stated that the cost of acquiring a new customer is far more than for retaining the existing one. Therefore, it is essential for the telecom industries to use advanced analytics to understand consumer behavior an, in turn, predict the association of the customers as whether or not they will leave the company.</br>
